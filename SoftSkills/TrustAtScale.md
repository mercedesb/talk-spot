trust is a slow intentional process and grows over time. 
plant, seed metaphor — when is a seed a plant? at what point do you say you trust?
are you someone who trusts until the other person gives you reason not to? Or are you someone who doesn't trust until the other person has given you good reason to?

Trust is built in very small moments

John Gottman “There is the opportunity to build trust, and there is the opportunity to betray, because as small as the moments of trust can be, those are the moments of betrayal as well, to choose to not connect when the opportunity is there, is a betrayal.”

Sincerity, Reliability, Competence, Care

Charles Feltman  “Trust is choosing to make something important to you vulnerable to the actions of someone else.”

Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-judgment, Generosity

reliability is, is you do what you say you’re going to do over and over and over again.

A, huge, accountability. I can only trust you if when you make a mistake, you’re willing to own it, apologize for it, and make amends. I can only trust you if when I make a mistake, I am allowed to own it, apologize, and make amends.

integrity is: Three pieces. It’s choosing courage over comfort, choosing what’s right over what’s fun, fast or easy, and practicing your values, not just professing your values.

For leaders who want to develop their ability to inspire trust, Horsager’s research at Trust Edge Leadership Institute has identified eight key qualities to focus on:

• Clarity. “People trust the clear, and they distrust the ambiguous,” Horsager says. Give employees a clear vision of where you want to go and what role they will play.

• Compassion. Leaders who care for more than just themselves inspire trust. 

• Character. This means choosing to do what’s right rather than what’s easy.

• Competency. Stay fresh, relevant and capable. 

• Commitment. Stick with your employees in the face of adversity, and they’ll do the same for you.

• Connection. Cultivate strong relationships with workers. Ask questions. Find common ground.

• Contribution. In other words, produce results. 

• Consistency. What we do all the time shapes what others expect of us. “If you’re late all the time, I will trust you to be late,” Horsager says. “It’s the sameness in a person that builds a reputation. It’s the sameness in a company that builds a brand.”

Dare to Lead: If trust is an issue, don’t talk about “trust” in the abstract but in specific behaviors that can repair/instill trust p. 225

Trust at scale: intentional communication for engineering leaders

"at the required size to solve the problem"
we often think that 'at scale' refers to large volumes and in software it can. but I'll argue that trust at scale is investing in our small interactions.

CTA/Message/Takeaway
Approach every interaction as an opportunity to build trust.

- Open up with a story that combines software scale with trust 
  - changing priorities is an evergreen problem facing engineering leaders. in my decade as a consultant, I've seen it in almost every client engagement I've had.
  - on a recent engagement, the client's main business goal was to scale up the volume their product could offer. and they'd been plagued by changing priorities in order to achieve this underlying goal. so much so that many of their projects over the last 12 months didn't actually ship. priorities were changing so fast and projects scoped so large, that teams never had a enough time to get something over the finish line before it was left on the cutting room floor in favor of the next big push to increase scale.
  - many of the ICs at the company were exhausted and left with little trust that their work was valued and time was well spent. every time a project was announced, there was little faith that they'd be able to finish it before it was all abandoned again.
  - low morale -> low retention/high attrition -> less domain knowledge -> bigger challenges to achieving software scale goals
- Tech moves fast. Consumer attention moves fast. We've all been in a situation where we need to "pivot" to stay relevant or change priorities to keep up with business goals. But building and investing in trust with our teams, customers, and company leadership can change the outcome of these changing priorities.

- John Gottman “There is the opportunity to build trust, and there is the opportunity to betray, because as small as the moments of trust can be, those are the moments of betrayal as well, to choose to not connect when the opportunity is there, is a betrayal.”
- Trust is built in small moments.
- We often think that 'at scale' refers to large volumes and in software it usually does. but at scale actually means at the required size to solve the problem. I'd argue that trust at scale is investing in our small interactions.
- If you look up the research on building trust, you'll find many different frameworks — Charles Feltman's 4 distinctions of trust, David Horsager's 8 Pillars or Brene Brown's BRAVING inventory. They're all insightful and whichever resonates with you is worthy. 
- 
- 
- They share similar themes, the most salient being 'reliability' or 'consistency'

- ** Story about reliability, consistency and small moments (down to the team or out to peers)
- ** Flesh out communication strategies for reliability
  
- Transition to competence/contribution/commitment
- Outline how where they should've done the work
  - preparation
  - admitting shortcomings (accountability)
  - willingness to do any work

- boundaries/clarity/non-judgment
- communication strategies
  - humanize the people
  - explicit timelines
  - say no and offer explanation
  - share plan for success & scaffold deliverables

- Transition to integrity/accountability
- communication strategies
  - we know what's wrong
  - follow up to clarify language

- Transition to care/compassion/character/generosity/sincerity/connection
- a decision has been made but how the decision is communicated is just as important as the decision itself
- maybe the decision can't be changed, but showing care for the folks affected can instill trust that you had their best interests at heart and advocated for them 

- wrap up with how to change the culture of changing priorities with transparency, explicit timelines, acknowledgment of shortcomings
  - what small communication investments could be made?

- Emphasize smallness of moments

- Reliable / Consistent
- Actionable / Practical / Useful
- Explicit / Clear
- Integrity / Values-driven / Authentic / Sincere / Genuine
- Caring

## Outline


## Description


## Abstract
Trust is an essential–and often overlooked–ingredient to any high-performing team. As an engineering leader, you are responsible for building trust along many axes: between you and your team, your team and company leadership, product and engineering, your customers and your brand, and more. Every interaction is an opportunity to build or weaken trust. Intentional communication builds trust to create a collaborative, accountable culture where teams thrive.
