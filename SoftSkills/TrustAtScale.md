## Outline


## Description


## Abstract
Trust is an essential–and often overlooked–ingredient to any high-performing team. As an engineering leader, you are responsible for building trust along many axes: between you and your team, your team and company leadership, product and engineering, your customers and your brand, and more. Every interaction is an opportunity to build or weaken trust. Intentional communication builds trust to create a collaborative, accountable culture where teams thrive.
