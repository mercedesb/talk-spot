# Talk Title
Minimize Your Circus Factor: Building resilient teams

## Format
30 min

## Brainstorm
- there's been and about to be a lot more churn in our industry after a year+ in a pandemic
- as a senior/lead/manager, your responsibility is to enable and empower your team to do their best work
- if you were to run away and join the circus, have you set your team up for success?
- documentation
- ride-alongs (e.g. when you have to do administrative things or not fun things, pair with someone for knowledge sharing)
- visibility into what your day looks like
- open calendars!!
- more verbose standup updates
- unfortunately it is not normalized yet to talk openly about job searching #capitalism so do what you can to support your people if you know you'll want to start searching
- support delivery, support careers, support process
- have a transition plan in mind
  - unfortunately, incompetent leaders will dump your workload on to the person you leave behind to figure it out
  - start thinking through what next steps need to happen: hiring, promotions, 
  - * I didn't do all of these, some I learned from my last transition
- keep job descriptions, READMEs, onboarding docs etc up to date
- loyalty to people not companies. you don't have to help the company succeed, but focus on the individuals on your team and how they can succeed
- you may not be able to do all of this depending on the culture of your company
- put things in 1Password! figure out what you own and what you're an admin on and start sharing ownership and adding other folks
- clean out your personal docs and put relevant, important ones in shared places
- build your team's credibility and stakeholders' trust in your team by loudly recognizing their accomplishments so that the transition if/when you leave is painless
  - this is also super empowering and does a ton for career growth
- make yourself available for questions
- always be explaining the why so that your team members have context for decisions
- show your process!
  - architecture -> show the diagrams and the strategies you didn't choose and why
  - estimates/timeline/priority -> show the roadmap iterations and explain how stakeholder priority overlaps with engineering priority
  - strategy and goals -> explain where they come from and the plan to acheive them
- commit messages and PR descriptions
  - links to documentation
  - explain the context and need for the change, who asked for it, etc rather than just describing the code change
  - explain how to test it!!!!
  - you never know... 6 months down the line context might be lost and if someone has to go on an archaeological dig to figure out why a feature exists, your PR might be the only thing to help them

## Audience
This talk is intended for anyone who cares about their team members and wants to enable their success should they want to take a long vacation to unplug or run away and join the circus. It's specifically targeted towards senior+, leads, and managers but the strategies shared will be relevant to all career levels and will help those early in their career develop good habits for when they are the senior folks on the team.


## Outcomes/Conclusions
By the end of this talk, my audience will have a new perspective on ownership and responsibility where success is viewed in terms of team empowerment and enablement rather than individual wins. They'll walk away with many small, low-friction changes to incorporate into their work day that will dramatically decrease their circus factor, increase team empowerment, and ultimately improve the team resilience should any big changes occur (long PTO, attrition/churn, company reorganization, etc).

## Description


## Abstract
If you or someone on your team ran away to join the circus, how stressful would it be for the rest of the team? How can we minimize that?

After a year+ in a pandemic, many are considering taking new roles or extended PTO. It's more important than ever to invest in minimizing our "circus factor" and building resilient teams so that everyone can unplug and do what's best for them with as little stress as possible. In this talk, we'll discuss low-friction changes you can make today so that if you join the circus tomorrow your team is empowered and enabled for continued success.
