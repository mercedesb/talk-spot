# Empowering Early-Career Developers

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
In our industry, we have a shortage of senior developers and an increase in the number of early-career developers looking for jobs. How can teams invest in and grow their less experienced developers into team-leading senior devs? I believe the first step is empowering them. 

On my team, we’ve created a process for each team member to lead and own one of our core features. Our early-career developers are learning client management and team leadership skills that they wouldn’t usually get to practice until they stepped into a senior role. In this talk, I’ll share our process and what we’ve learned so you can give your less experienced developers valuable experience they need to become successful, senior developers.

## Description


## Audience
Senior and lead developers who are looking to improve their leadership and mentorship skills.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
After this talk, the audience will learn about the experience with our 'domain experts' at DevMynd on our large projects and ideas for ways to empower the junior developers on their projects.

## Outline

## Brainstorm
- surplus of junior developers in the market and growing scarcity of senior developers
- need to increase our investment into junior devs
- grow junior devs into senior devs
- first step is empowering them and giving them ownership
- learning new tech is always a given on projects, but learning client management skills and team leadership skills is not
- case study of how we're doing it on MIRS
- clearly identify the role and responsibilities
- what went well, what was bumpy
- feedback is so important (ex. more prep before meetings, etc)
- delegation is a skill that needs practice
- learn when to support and when to take a step back
- check in: how are they feeling? are they overwhelmed? is there something they wish they were doing/learning but aren't?
