# Empowering Early-Career Developers

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
In our industry, we have a shortage of senior developers and an increase in the number of early-career developers looking for jobs. How can teams invest in and grow their less experienced developers into team-leading senior devs? I believe the first step is empowering them. 

On my team, we’ve created a process for each team member to lead and own one of our core features. Our early-career developers are learning client management and team leadership skills that they wouldn’t usually get to practice until they stepped into a senior role. In this talk, I’ll share our process and what we’ve learned so you can give your less experienced developers valuable experience they need to become successful, senior developers.

## Description
We're seeing many companies shy away from hiring and supporting early-career developers because the investment to grow them into senior level developers is "too high." Consistently looking externally to hire senior developers is not sustainable. We, as an industry, need to start investing in newer generations of developers and prioritize mentorship in order to empower them to learn and grow into the experienced developers we need.

My team has been iterating on a process that empowers all of our team members to practice leadership and communication skills required to be a successful team lead and experienced contributor while also supporting them to grow technically.  This talk will present my team's experience with supporting early-career development growth and our experiment with creating a process for each team member to be the lead dev on one of our core features. I'll present what went well, what we've improved, and what we've learned from the process.

This talk is intended for team leads or senior folks who want to improve the mentorship they're offering their less experienced team members. The audience will walk away from this talk with ideas to empower and support their team members.
