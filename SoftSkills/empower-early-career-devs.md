# Empowering Early-Career Developers

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
In our industry, we have a shortage of senior developers and an increase in the number of early-career developers looking for jobs. How can teams invest in and grow their less experienced developers into team-leading senior devs? I believe the first step is empowering them. 

On my team, we’ve created a process for each team member to lead and own one of our core features. Our early-career developers are learning client management and team leadership skills that they wouldn’t usually get to practice until they stepped into a senior role. In this talk, I’ll share our process and what we’ve learned so you can give your less experienced developers valuable experience they need to become successful, senior developers.

## Description
We're seeing many companies shy away from hiring and supporting early-career developers because the investment to grow them into senior level developers is "too high." Consistently looking externally to hire senior developers is not sustainable. We, as an industry, need to start investing in newer generations of developers and prioritize mentorship in order to empower them to learn and grow into the experienced developers we need.

My team has been iterating on a process that empowers all of our team members to practice leadership and communication skills required to be a successful team lead and experienced contributor while also supporting them to grow technically.  This talk will present my team's experience with supporting early-career development growth and our experiment with creating a process for each team member to be the lead dev on one of our core features. I'll present what went well, what we've improved, and what we've learned from the process.

This talk is intended for team leads or senior folks who want to improve the mentorship they're offering their less experienced team members. The audience will walk away from this talk with ideas to empower and support their team members.

## Audience

This talk is intended for team leads or senior folks who want to improve the mentorship they're offering their less experienced team members. 

This talk is intended for senior/lead developers who are passionate about mentorship and who are interested in learning new ways to empower and support their team. It is also an interesting talk for those early in their career to see opportunities they can ask for and the kinds of goals they can set in their own career growth.

At the end of this talk, my audience will have a deeper appreciation for the importance of mentorship and providing opportunities for their team members to learn and grow from, as well as a concrete framework for creating a process tailored to their team's specific needs to facilitate those types of opportunities. 

## Outcomes/Conclusions
After this talk, the audience will learn about the experience with our 'domain experts' at DevMynd on our large projects and ideas for ways to empower the junior developers on their projects.


## Other details

## Outline
1. Intro (5 min)
  - Who am I?
  - Reflect on our early career experiences
  - Identify the challenge with the current job/tech market
2. What does it mean to empower our team and why is it important? (5 min)
  - Define/unpack "empower"
  - Define/unpack "early-career"
  - Reframe junior as early-career
  - What makes a senior developer? And how do we get there?
3. My current team process (feature ownership) and what we've learned (10 min)
  - Prepare: how we came up with the idea and planned to implement it
  - Propose: how we introduced it to the team and created shared understanding
  - Practice: how we put it into practice, what did it look like in real life?
  - What have we learned from this new process?
4. How can you create a process tailored specifically to your team using strategies like this? (10 min)
  - Prepare: identify values, gaps, and scope to define a purpose. From there, identify responsibilities that will achieve the purpose.
  - Propose: work with your team and gather feedback to iterate and improve ideas. Make sure the plan feels sustainable.
  - Practice: the importance of delegating and specifics of how to support your team as they take on new responsibilities

## Brainstorm
- surplus of junior developers in the market and growing scarcity of senior developers
- need to increase our investment into junior devs
- grow junior devs into senior devs
- first step is empowering them and giving them ownership
- learning new tech is always a given on projects, but learning client management skills and team leadership skills is not
- case study of how we're doing it on MIRS
- clearly identify the role and responsibilities
- what went well, what was bumpy
- feedback is so important (ex. more prep before meetings, etc)
- delegation is a skill that needs practice
- learn when to support and when to take a step back
- check in: how are they feeling? are they overwhelmed? is there something they wish they were doing/learning but aren't?
