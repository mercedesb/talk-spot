## Outline


## Brainstorm
- preschool teachers
  - client management: identify feelings, summarize decisions, provide realistic choices
- hair stylists
  - consulting skills: understanding the request and identifying goals, help your client understand the process, talk budget, choices as a feedback tool
- the crafting community
  - onboarding: be welcoming, clarify shared language, multiple modes of communication
- road construction
  - estimating: knowing the terminology, breaking down the process, accurate estimates lead to more work
- bartending
  - prioritization: getting a drink at a bar is not a FIFO policy, better tippers (or higher value features) get higher priority, customers that want a recommendation get bumped to the bottom when there's time to have a conversation, and customers who clearly don't need another drink (or features that may cause more harm than good) get ignored
- vet tech
  - difficult conversations
- theater
  - project management skills?
- appreciating career switchers skills
