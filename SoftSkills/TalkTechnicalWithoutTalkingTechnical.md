## Longer abstract
From the most senior architect to recent bootcamp grad, we all need to explain abstract technology concepts to non-technical audiences. After this talk, you will walk away with techniques for communicating complex technical concepts in an approachable way that excites and empowers your stakeholders. Your stakeholders will be more likely to share your passion for tech and understand how your ideas will benefit their business. You will be more confident and as a result, the decision makers will have more confidence in you and the innovations you are pitching.

## Description

Think back to the last time you needed to communicate a technical concept to a client or executive in your company. You knew there were big benefits to be had by rearchitecting the data model or refactoring that monolithic application into a microservice architecture. Were you met with blank stares? Or a defensive attitude about how it cost too much and wasn't worth it?

What about a lower stakes scenario where you were conducting a discovery workshop with a new client and you had so many ideas you could implement to improve their business. Were you able to communicate those ideas in a way that excited everyone in the room with you?

Or maybe you are early in your technology career and technical communication was never taught in your classroom. How do you begin?

After this talk, you will walk away with techniques for communicating complex technical concepts to a non-technical audience. Your stakeholders will be more likely to share your passion for tech and understand how your ideas will benefit their business. You will be more confident and as a result, the decision makers will have more confidence in you and the innovations you are pitching.


## Audience
Developers and engineers who have the know-how to deliver innovative solutions to their clients, but want to improve their vocabulary and communication techniques when talking to their non-technical stakeholders.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
The audience will walk away with techniques to try next time they are faced with having to explain technical concepts in order to get buy-in from a non-technical audience.

## Other details
This talk is both theoretical and practical. I'll present techniques for the audience to use in daily work and (time permitting) provide time to practice those skills with short guided activities.

My intended audience is developers and engineers who have the know-how to deliver innovative solutions to their clients, but want to improve their vocabulary and communication techniques when talking to their non-technical stakeholders. This talk will be suitable for all experience levels, but most useful to the lead developers in the room who are responsible for communicating their technical decisions to the team at large and stakeholders.

## Outline

## Brainstorm
- Metaphors are your friend
- Plain english, avoid the vocab words and acronyms
- Listen to your audience and understand their real concerns. Don't dive headfirst into the wrong explanation
- Ask about their background and talk on their level
- Don't be afraid to draw
- Pay attention to body language
- Talk slow, spend more time with a complex concept than you would for a technical concept
- Don't go too deep. For example, you don't need to explain the ins and outs of a messaging protocol for the person to understand that a message is sent and received.
- Explain interactions from a userâ€™s POV rather than how the system/tech works

- We are all familiar with the stereotype that developers and engineers don't know how to communicate like real people.
