They'll have a concrete process to follow as well as examples to draw from when creating their career path or expectation document for their organization.

## Description


## Abstract
I get asked a lot about how to build a welcoming and collaborative team culture. One of the most crucial but often overlooked tools for building culture is a company's career path. A career path communicates an organization's expectations and outlines what behaviors will be rewarded. A thoughtful career path is a foundational element to building the type of culture you want on your team. In this talk, we'll cover how to create a career path that is inclusive and supports more effective promotion and performance conversations.
