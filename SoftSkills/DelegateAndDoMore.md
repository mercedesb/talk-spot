# Delegate and do more

## Format
20 min talk (originally submitted to CTO summit)
Easily a 45 minute talk...

## Brainstorm
- gut check yourself: can you commit to delegating? are you hoarding work?
- what is a good task to delegate?
- last 4 months of the year, new code challenges and revamped apprenticeship
- clear expectations
- need a solid foundation in place first (career path)
- create a framework for decisions (prioritization?) before you're faced with making them
  - this allows the person to feel confident making decisions independently
- delegate the opportunity to someone who's skills and goals align with the task
- commit to an accountability plan that works for that person
- importance of gratitude
- recognition: show the person the impact of their work
- make yourself available to support the person through new challenges
- what does delegation signal to your team member? trust, belief, confidence

## Audience
Managers or team leads who have a lot on their plate and a team of people who could use more career opportunity.

## Description


## Abstract
As a leader, the transition from “doing” to “leading” is one of the hardest. You are measured by what you and your team achieve, but there aren’t enough hours in the day to do it all yourself. Delegating is the key to achieving more but is a challenging skill to learn and an even harder one to be good at. We’ll cover how to prepare yourself to “let go,” how to know what and when to delegate and to who, and a framework of support so you can be sure that your team members are successful in their new responsibilities. 

Last year, my company had bold goals in nearly every area of the business—hiring, sales, and process. Over Q2 and Q3, we had significant leadership changes and dipping morale on the team. How could the new leaders manage the massive workload while restoring confidence with the team? We embraced delegation and finding opportunities to challenge our team members.
