## Description

Interviewing in tech is a mess. It's so bad that many people will choose to stay in a toxic job longer to avoid the mental and emotional toll of interviewing. And many developers dread conducting interviews or even worse, look forward to the opportunity to show their superiority. But it doesn't have to be like that.

Interviews are as much for you to learn about a candidate as they are for a candidate to learn about you. Every step in an interview process is an opportunity to make the candidate feel safe and welcome so they can get to know what it would be like to work with you.

In this talk, we will cover how to evaluate your current hiring processes and find opportunities to make them more welcoming for your candidates. We'll walk away with specific strategies to make the interview process more enjoyable for your team and your candidates.

## Abstract

Interviewing in tech is a nightmare, but it doesn't have to be. Every step in your hiring process is an opportunity to make your candidate feel safe and welcome. Your candidate should learn what it's like to work with you and should feel empowered and successful so you can see what it's like when they're doing their best work.

This talk will cover how to evaluate your current hiring processes and how to identify opportunities to make them more positive and welcoming, after which you will be able to implement specific strategies to make your interviews more enjoyable for your team and your candidates.
