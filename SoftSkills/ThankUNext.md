# Thank u, next: learn from and find gratitude in project failures

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
Ariana Grande sings to us, "One taught me love, one taught me patience, one taught me pain, now I'm so amazing." We can all benefit from looking at our project mishaps with this perspective. Every mistake, oops, and failure can teach us something valuable. In this talk, we'll look at some real examples of project failures at all scales, what can be learned from those mistakes, and strategies to remove shame and fear and learn from project failures. We will embrace "Thank u, next," learn, and be amazing.
