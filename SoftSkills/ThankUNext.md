# Thank u, next: learn from and find gratitude in project failures

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
Ariana Grande sings to us, "One taught me love, one taught me patience, one taught me pain, now I'm so amazing." We can all benefit from looking at our project mishaps with this perspective. Every mistake, oops, and failure can teach us something valuable. In this talk, we'll look at some real examples of project failures at all scales, what can be learned from those mistakes, and strategies to remove shame and fear and learn from project failures. We will embrace "Thank u, next," learn, and be amazing.

## Description

## Outcomes/Conclusions

- Examples of real mistakes and their learnings
- Strategies to remove blame, shame, and fear following project mishaps


## Other details

## Pitch
There is intense pressure in our industry for individuals to be perfect and not make mistakes. We see this in people covering up enormous data breaches and other technical mistakes, but also in the rampant imposter syndrome because so few people acknowledge and share mistakes with their teams. I think we can benefit both as individual team members and as an industry if we embrace a learning mindset and share our growth from past failures. In this talk, I'll be sharing not only large scale industry fails but also personal mistakes I've made in the past to 'walk the walk.' And this is all done through the lens of Ariana Grande's smash hit "Thank u, next."
