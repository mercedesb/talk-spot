I'm Mercedes Bernard, and I'm a Software Engineer who doesn't just write code for my clients, but values them as a partner in building a product that meets the needs of the humans who use it. Having worked with clients in a wide range of industries including (but not limmited to!) healthcare, performing arts, beverage distribution, pet food, hospitality, luxury consumer goods, and government, I understand that no one knows your domain better than you do.

I bring a unique blend of technical know-how, non-technical language, and empathy to all of my projects. My clients walk away feeling empowered, comfortable, and heard. The specific technology and stack used aren't important if you don't love it when we're done.

I earned my BS in computer science from DePaul University. Outside of work, I try to unplug. I really enjoy fiber arts, particularly dyeing wool, spinning yarn, and crocheting.
