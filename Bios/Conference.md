Mercedes Bernard is a senior software engineer with Tandem in Chicago, Illinois. She has worked with clients in a wide range of industries including (but not limited to!) healthcare, performing arts, beverage distribution, hospitality, luxury consumer goods, and government. In her projects, she values technical know-how, non-technical language, and empathy so her clients and team members feel empowered, comfortable, and heard. Outside of work, she tries to unplug and enjoys fiber arts, particularly dyeing wool, spinning yarn, and crocheting. She's also started a mentorship community in Chicago for those starting their dev careers called Dev Together.

Mercedes Bernard is VP of Delivery with Tandem, a digital consultancy headquartered in Chicago. When she's coding, she loves refactoring and optimizing Rails appsâ€“but most days, she prefers to support teams shipping quality software products while helping them find their strengths. Throughout her career in software, Mercedes has strived to create a welcoming environment for early-career devs, speaking often about mentorship and coaching. Outside of work, Mercedes likes to unplug by working in fiber arts: she enjoys spinning yarn and crocheting, and recently has been embroidering a series of portraits of historical women.
