Mercedes Bernard is a senior software engineer with DevMynd in Chicago, Illinois. She has worked with clients in a wide range of industries including (but not limited to!) healthcare, performing arts, beverage distribution, pet food, hospitality, luxury consumer goods, and government. In her projects, she values technical know-how, non-technical language, and empathy so her clients and team members feel empowered, comfortable, and heard. She earned her degree in computer science from DePaul University with a minor in American Sign Language studies (but those skills are a little rusty). Outside of work, she tries to unplug and enjoys fiber arts, particularly dyeing wool, spinning yarn, and crocheting.
