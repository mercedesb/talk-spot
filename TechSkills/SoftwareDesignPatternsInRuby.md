# How to Implement Software Design Patterns across Type Systems

#### Basic software design patterns and how the implementation differs between statically typed and dynamically typed languages

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
Short and punchy.  A few sentences.

## Description
How do you code to the interface if there is no concept of an interface type in your language? Or the reverse: you've never had an Interface before, how do you use it?

Object oriented languages exist both as statically-typed and dynamically-typed, but how we implement design patterns differs due to the respective type system. Design patterns provide software engineers a wide array of tools to choose from when solving problems. They give us a common language when talking about our code and are flexible enough to be used across any and all domains. In this talk, we'll explore how the high-level concepts of the type system change the implementation of design patterns and provide concrete examples of some common patterns.

Don't miss out on the benefits design patterns regardless of what language you are using.

## Audience
Who is the audience for?
Developers who are passionate about code quality and switch between languages often or are new to a language and/or type system..

## Outcomes/Conclusions
After this talk, the audience will understand and feel comfortable implementing some common software design patterns in both statically and dynamically typed languages.

## Outline

- what is a design pattern?
- what are their benefits?
- how do they specifically help code quality?
- statically vs dynamically typed
