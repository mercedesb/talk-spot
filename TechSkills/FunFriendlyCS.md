# Fun, Friendly Computer Science

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
Computer science concepts like Big O Notation, set theory, data structures, and principles of object-oriented programming sound intimidating, but they don’t have to be! This talk will dive into some fundamental computer science topics and debunk the myth that only ‘real’ programmers know CS.

Whether you are a bootcamp grad, self-taught career switcher, or someone who, like me, didn't pay attention in night class, join me as we explore some computer science theory behind the code we write every day through fun illustrations and real-world examples.

## Description


## Audience
This talk is intended for people who entered the tech industry through non-traditional means and who may not have learned theoretical computer science in their coding education. This talk is also for people who, like me, zoned out during a few CS classes and could use a refresher.


## Outcomes/Conclusions
My goal with this talk is to show that these traditional computer science topics that are used in interviews and sometimes used for gatekeeping aren’t intimidating and also aren’t really that important because a) you probably already know it and just don’t have the words to explain it and b) you really don’t use it very often.

The audience will walk away from this talk with a high-level understanding of multiple CS topics as well as metaphors that they can use to explain them and code examples that they can refer to later if they want to dig deeper.


## Other details

## Pitch
I have a 4-year CS degree but I very rarely use the computer science theory I learned in school. My most valuable learning experience was my first job where I learned how to code in the real world. I've never needed to know how a compiler works (despite building one in school) or needed to give much thought to sorting algorithm performance since most languages and frameworks take care of that already. 

Some of the smartest people I've worked with do not have a 4-year degree and are self-taught or switched careers with the help of a coding bootcamp. Despite their clear skills and motivation, they suffer unnecessary imposter syndrome and second guess their talents because they don't know what Big O notation is or other silly computer science theory. Being able to write readable, maintainable, and extensible code does not require understanding theoretical computer science and that knowledge should not be used to gatekeep people out of this industry.

I want to present some of the intimidating CS fundamentals in a welcoming and fun way to make people realize 1) CS isn't scary 2) CS isn't impossible and 3) CS isn't strictly necessary.

## Short pitch
My background is in traditional computer science, and my degree made me spend a lot of time digging into the theory. But the longer I'm in this industry, the more I realize I rarely use all of that theory that I learned. But people with non-traditional career paths into software may have never had the opportunity to learn these things and may feel like they aren't a "real programmer" during an interview because they don't know them. My goal is to debunk that myth and leave the audience (of all experience levels) feeling empowered to explain these topics. And for those who did learn these things once, I hope to provide some updated and more inclusive examples to take back and share with devs that they're mentoring (no sports metaphors here!).
