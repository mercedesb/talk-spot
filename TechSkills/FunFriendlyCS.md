# Fun, Friendly Computer Science

## Format

* Full talk

## Abstract
Computer science concepts like propositional logic, set theory, data structures, and Big O Notation sound intimidating, but they don’t have to be! This talk will dive into some fundamental computer science topics and debunk the myth that only ‘real’ programmers know CS.

Whether you are a bootcamp grad, self-taught career switcher, or someone who, like me, didn't pay attention in night class, join me as we explore some computer science theory behind the code we write every day through fun illustrations and real-world examples.
## Description


## Audience
This talk is intended for people who entered the tech industry through non-traditional means and who may not have learned theoretical computer science in their coding education. This talk is also for people who, like me, zoned out during a few CS classes and could use a refresher.

## Pitch
I have a 4-year CS degree but I very rarely use the computer science theory I learned in school. My most valuable learning experience was my first job where I learned how to code in the real world. I've never needed to know how a compiler works (despite building one in school) or needed to give much thought to sorting algorithm performance since most languages and frameworks take care of that already. 

Some of the smartest people I've worked with do not have a 4-year degree and are self-taught or switched careers with the help of a coding bootcamp. Despite their clear skills and motivation, they suffer unnecessary imposter syndrome and second guess their talents because they don't know what Big O notation is or other silly computer science theory. Being able to write readable, maintainable, and extensible code does not require understanding theoretical computer science and that knowledge should not be used to gatekeep people out of this industry.

I want to present some of the intimidating CS fundamentals in a welcoming and fun way to make people realize 1) CS isn't scary 2) CS isn't impossible and 3) CS isn't strictly necessary.

## Outline


## Brainstorm
- computer science elitism
- computer science isn't scary
- difference between computer science & software engineering
- many of these things are not NEED TO KNOW
- prepositional logic
  - !(A && B) == !A || !B
- Set theory
  - how set theory drives relational databases
  - intersect
  - union
  - set difference
  - cartesian product (join)
- data structures
  - linked lists (toy trains)
  - stacks (blocks, plates at a buffet)
  - queues (milk at a grocery store)
  - graphs
- Big O Notation
- when should you use these things and think about it?
