# Fun, Friendly SOLID Principles

## Format
45 min talk

## Brainstorm
- single responsibilitiy
- open-closed
- liskov - who is she? and what is her principle?
- interface segregation
- dependency injection
- what is each one?
- why is it important? why is it best practice?
- by using it, how is the code "better"?
- examples of the same problem _with_ and _without_ the principle in practice


## Audience
This talk is intended for people who entered the tech industry through non-traditional means and who may not have learned theoretical computer science and software engineering principles in their coding education. 

It is also for people who may be rusty on SOLID and what it means or who have learned it as 'best practice' but never understood _why_ it has become accepted and what makes each principle a good idea.


## Outcomes/Conclusions
The audience will walk away from this talk entertained and feeling accomplished having learned something usually characterized as "hard computer science." The examples will be approachable, inclusive, and broken down so that regardless of experience level, the audience will understand each principle, what it looks like in practice, and why it's important in code.


## Outline

- B. Single responsibility principle 
- C. Open-closed principle
- D. Liskov substitution principle
    - Who was Liskov?

## Description


## Abstract
As coders, we often hear about SOLID principles and maybe even get quizzed on them in interviews. But what are they and what makes them so special that they get accepted as "best practice" without challenge? This talk will dig into the 5 SOLID principles and why they make our code "better."

Whether you are a bootcamp grad, self-taught career switcher, or someone who, like me, could always use a refresher, join me as we explore the computer science theory behind the code we write every day through fun illustrations and real-world examples.
