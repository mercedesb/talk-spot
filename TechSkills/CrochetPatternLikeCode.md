# Writing Crochet Patterns is like Writing Code

## Format


## Abstract
You wouldn't believe how similar writing a crochet pattern is to writing code. There are hardware requirements, different languages, loops, methods, and modeling diagrams. I'll show how reading and writing crochet patterns uses many of the same fundamental principles as coding.

## Description
We all have hobbies we like to do when we leave the office, but that doesn't mean we have to shut down our programmer minds at the end of the day. I love to crochet in my spare time and in many cases, the approach to crafting is the same as coding. You wouldn't believe how similar writing a crochet pattern is to writing code. There are hardware requirements, different languages, loops, methods, and modeling diagrams.

In this talk, I'll show how reading and writing crochet patterns uses many of the same fundamental principles as coding, complete with Ruby code samples and personal crochet samples. You will walk away thinking about coding principles and their applications beyond your screen. You might even become interested in learning to crochet!

## Audience
Who is the audience for?
Anyone interested in thinking about code in the real world beyond the digital plane.

## Outcomes/Conclusions
What will the audience get out of this talk? What do I want them to come
away with?
After this talk, the audience will have their interest piqued and learn a little about how writing a pattern is like writing code.

## Outline

## Brainstorm
- old-fashioned and unrelated to code, but it's not
- literal yarn loops and repeated instruction loops
- Starting projects is the hardest part whether its creating a new shawl pattern or building a new app. You need to track down all of your hardware requirements and try to wrap your head around the solution you are trying to craft.
- Trial and error
- testing your methods and loops
- Undoing and redoing, rewriting and rewriting, it's all the same. In crochet we call it 'frogging,' as in 'rip-it, rip-it, rip-it' and when we're coding we class it up with 'refactoring,' but at the end of the day there is a lot of reworking until your stitches look just right or your code runs correctly and optimally.
