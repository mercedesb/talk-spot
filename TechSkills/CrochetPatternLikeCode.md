## Format


## Abstract

## Description
We all have hobbies we like to do outside of our work life. Many of us even like to come out from behind our screens when we're not at work. One of my personal loves is crochet and despite seeming very old fashioned and unrelated to coding, it's incredibly similar. Even though I may not be letting code flow through my fingers, when I'm crocheting I'm still thinking in terms of different languages, methods, and loops--both literal yarn loops and the repeated parts of code we're all more familiar with.

In this talk, I'll show how reading and writing crochet patterns uses many of the same fundamental principles of coding. I hope to get you thinking about other applications of
