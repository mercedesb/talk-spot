# Talk Title

The Art of Estimation

## Format

30 min talk

## Brainstorm

- just put ideas here

## Audience

Developers who would like to get better at estimating their work. This talk builds on itself so we start with personal scope of work and gradually grow into sprint or project scope level estimates making it suitable for developers of all experience levels.

## Outcomes/Conclusions

At the end of this talk, the audience will have a concrete list of considerations to think about when estimating both for their personal scope of work or for a sprint/project-level scope of work.

## Pitch

I've spent many years working as a consultant who has to bill their time hourly. With so much awareness of time-spent and accountability to my estimates, I've developed a keen skill in both guessing how long something will take and communicating complexity to stakeholders so that they understand. Whether you choose to estimate in time or complexity, there are considerations you should always remember and strategies to help account for unknowns. I've developed some tips & tricks that I've found helpful whenever I have to estimate and I'd love to share that with others.

## Description

## Abstract

Estimating is one of the hardest parts of the building something--shipping software, constructing houses, or assembling Ikea furniture. There are a lot of unknowns and no right or wrong answers. Estimates are essential planning and communication tools for healthy teams. In this talk, we'll break down the process of creating an estimate and communicating your thought behind it so that you and others have more confidence in your educated guesses.
