Coaching through coding

## Format

30 min

## Brainstorm

- Coding activities are more than just physically writing lines of code
  - PRs and code reviews
  - architecture discussions
  - estimating
  - researching tools
- Pair programming
  - Navigate for the hard stuff
  - Drive and let them navigate the stretch opportunities
  - Have them navigate during debugging sessions
- Postive comments on their PRs, highlight why you enjoy the pattern they used
- Open-ended questions about their code to open the door for coaching
- Leave comments in your PRs for them to review and learn from (documentation links, non-obvious considerations, why you chose to do something a certain way)
- Share what you tried and didn't work or why you chose one approach over another
- Diagrams to show architectural thought process
  - Discuss trade-offs
- Share joy in learning
  - No matter how small something you learned is, share it with them and show that we're always learning
  - Ask them about what they learned and have them explain it to you
- Estimating - have them explain why low and you explain why high
- Research together and explain documentation that's confusing

As individual contributors, our success is often measured in the technical problems we solve. But team success is marked by continuous learning and growth. It can be hard to find coaching and mentorship opportunities outside of traditional 1:1 conversation strategy.

Even if you aren't a people manager, there is opportunity for you to to support your team members' professional and technical growth. In this talk, we'll identify strategies for coaching in the technical activities you already do every day and open our minds to look for opportunities in every activity during a work day.

The term "individual contributor" is one given to senior, technical team members whose career trajectory is focused on solving technical problems. Because there is no people management in the job description, coaching and mentorship are often deprioritized. Just because people management isn't a job responsibility, doesn't mean there isn't ample opportunity for mentorship, coaching and supporting your teams' professional growth.

Often, there is too much emphasis on their personal skills rather than their ability to level up the rest of their team members.

It can be hard to find coaching and mentorship opportunities outside of the more traditional 1:1 conversation strategy. But every activity during a work day is an opportunity to level up your team members.

Even if you aren't a people manager, there is opportunity for you to to support your team members' professional and technical growth.

In this talk, we'll identify strategies for coaching in the technical activities you already do every day. [something something]

When we use the words "coaching" or "mentorship," we tend to picture one-on-one conversations with someone we respect where there are a lot of questions and asked and advice given. Coffee optional. But restricting our vision of mentorship to this type of interaction is extremely limiting!

Every activity during your work day is an opportunity to support your team members' career growth, including writing code, opening pull requests, and estimating tickets. In this talk, we'll identify strategies for coaching in the coding and other technical activities we do every day and open our minds to look for opportunities in non-traditional places.

## Pitch

In my current role, I have people management and code delivery responsibilities. As a manager, I am passionate about my team's career growth and goals. By having a role that is both management and individual contributor, I have explored different coaching and mentorship techniques so that I can continue to support my team's growth even when I have to be hands-on-keyboard for the week.

I feel like many developers view mentorship as a formal relationship that is characterized by "mentorship conversations" rather than using it as a lens through which to view every interaction. When you're able to turn every activity into an opportunity for coaching, you can support your team's goals without it feeling clunky and formal--whether that's by being intentional about whether you're the driver or navigator during a pair programming session or by proactively leaving comments on your own pull request with links to blog posts and documentation for them to read while they review.

I'd love to start a conversation with the community about how we can support each other in all of our activities, not just when we schedule time for mentorship.

## Description

## Abstract

When we use the words "coaching" or "mentorship," we tend to picture one-on-one conversations with someone we respect where there are questions asked and advice given. But restricting our vision of mentorship to this type of interaction is extremely limiting!

Every activity during your workday is an opportunity to support your team members' career growth, including writing code, opening pull requests, and estimating tickets. In this talk, we'll identify strategies for coaching in our everyday technical activities and open our minds to look for opportunities in non-traditional places.
